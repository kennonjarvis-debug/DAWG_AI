  Build a reusable StatCard component that can be used across all dashboards
  to replace duplicate stat card implementations (found in 3+ places).

  - Color variants: blue, purple, green, red, neutral
  - Trend indicators with up/down arrows and percentage
  - Icon support (lucide-react icons)
  - Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Uses design system tokens from components/ui/design-system/tokens.css
  - Glass morphism effect (floating-card style)

acceptance_criteria:
  - Component file created at src/components/StatCard/StatCard.tsx
  - Props interface defined with TypeScript
  - Used in tasks-dashboard as proof-of-concept (replace 3 duplicate cards)
  - Tested on mobile (390px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px)
  - No TypeScript errors
  - Matches design system aesthetic (dark glass, neon accents)

deliverables:
  - src/components/StatCard/StatCard.tsx
  - src/components/StatCard/index.ts (export)
  - Updated app/tasks-dashboard/page.tsx (using StatCard)
  - Screenshot of StatCard in all color variants

dependencies:
  - Design system (tokens.css, utils.css) - ✅ Complete
  - tasks-dashboard page - ✅ Exists
