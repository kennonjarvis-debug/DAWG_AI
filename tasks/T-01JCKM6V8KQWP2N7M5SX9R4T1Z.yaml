priority: P2
owner: instance-4

rationale: |
  Gamification and motivation through milestone tracking. Celebrates achievements
  and sets clear goals for user progression through the journey.

scope:
  - Visual milestone badges/achievements
  - Progress bar toward next milestone
  - Milestone categories (pitch mastery, consistency, song completion)
  - Unlock notifications with celebrations
  - Streak tracking (consecutive practice days)

out_of_scope:
  - Social leaderboards (Phase 2)
  - Custom milestone creation
  - Rewards/points system

interfaces:
  rest:
    - GET /api/milestones
    - POST /api/milestones/unlock
    - GET /api/milestones/user/:userId
  events:
    produces:
      - milestone.unlocked
      - streak.updated
    consumes:
      - session.completed
      - performance.scored

acceptance_criteria:
  - Display unlocked and locked milestones with icons
  - Progress bar shows % toward next milestone
  - Unlock animation/notification when milestone achieved
  - Streak counter shows consecutive practice days
  - Integration into UserProfileCard and Progress view

test_plan:
  unit:
    - Milestone unlock logic
    - Progress calculation
    - Streak counter logic
  integration:
    - Milestone unlocking from session events
    - Notification system
  e2e:
    - User completes sessions, unlocks milestone, sees celebration

risk: low
estimate: 1.5 days

dependencies:
  - PerformanceScorer (existing)
  - SessionPlanner (existing)

technical_notes: |
  - Define milestone schema in /src/types/milestones.ts
  - Store progress in localStorage with cloud sync option
