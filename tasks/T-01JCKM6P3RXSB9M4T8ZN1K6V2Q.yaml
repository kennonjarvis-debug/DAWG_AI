rationale: |
  AIFeedbackTimeline widget already exists but is not integrated into the journey page.
  Provides chronological AI feedback across sessions showing improvement trends.
  Users see their journey progress with AI-generated insights over time.

scope:
  - Import AIFeedbackTimeline into journey page
  - Integrate into Progress view
  - Connect to existing performance/session data
  - Add filter controls in UI
  - Style to match journey aesthetic

out_of_scope:
  - Widget modification (already built and functional)
  - New AI feedback generation logic
  - Social sharing features

interfaces:
  events:
    consumes:
      - session.completed
      - performance.scored
      - ai.feedback.generated (from existing event bus)

acceptance_criteria:
  - AIFeedbackTimeline displays in Progress view of journey page
  - Shows feedback from coaching sessions
  - Filter controls work for different feedback types
  - Styling matches journey page aesthetic
  - No TypeScript or build errors

test_plan:
  integration:
    - Import widget into /app/journey/page.tsx
    - Verify event bus connection
    - Test filter functionality
  e2e:
    - User completes coaching session, sees feedback in timeline
    - User filters timeline by feedback type

risk: low
estimate: 0.5 days

dependencies: []
