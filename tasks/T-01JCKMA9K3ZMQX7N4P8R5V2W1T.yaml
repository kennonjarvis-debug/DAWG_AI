title: "Integrate VocalEffectsPanel into Journey Coaching Sessions"

status: ready
priority: P2
owner: instance-2

rationale: |
  VocalEffectsPanel exists for applying vocal effects but not integrated into journey.
  Users need to apply effects during practice to hear polished sound and boost confidence.
  Helps users understand how effects transform their raw vocals.

scope:
  - Import VocalEffectsPanel into journey page
  - Add to coaching session overlay (alongside PerformanceScorer)
  - Connect to audio context for real-time FX
  - Preset effects for different vocal styles
  - Save effect settings with session

out_of_scope:
  - Custom effect creation
  - Effect automation/mixing
  - Export with effects (Phase 3)

interfaces:
  events:
    produces:
      - effects.applied
      - effects.preset.selected
    consumes:
      - coaching.session.started
      - audio.context.ready

acceptance_criteria:
  - VocalEffectsPanel accessible in coaching overlay
  - Effects apply in real-time during recording/playback
  - Preset selection works correctly
  - Effect settings saved with session metadata
  - No audio glitches or latency issues

test_plan:
  integration:
    - Import widget into /app/journey/page.tsx
    - Connect to audio context
    - Test effect application
  e2e:
    - User starts coaching, applies reverb effect, hears change
    - User saves session with effect settings
    - Effect settings persist on session replay

risk: medium
estimate: 1 day

dependencies:
  - T-01JCKM7B2PMZK8V4N3WX6Q9R1T (Real-time Audio Integration - for audio context)

technical_notes: |
  - Widget exists at /src/widgets/VocalEffectsPanel/
  - Requires audio context from coaching session
  - Add to coaching overlay as collapsible panel or tab
  - Could integrate with existing useVocalEffects hook
