created_at: 2025-10-03T03:42:00Z

status: ready
priority: P1-B
owner: instance-3

rationale: |
  ExerciseLibrary widget exists with vocal warm-up exercises but is not integrated.
  Essential for coaching sessions - users need guided exercises before recording.
  High value-add for user success and vocal health.

scope:
  - Import ExerciseLibrary into journey page
  - Add to coaching session workflow (pre-recording warm-up)
  - Create "Warm Up" button/section in coaching overlay
  - Connect exercise completion to session tracking
  - Style to match journey aesthetic

out_of_scope:
  - Creating new exercises (use existing library)
  - Exercise customization/creation UI
  - Video demonstrations (Phase 3)

interfaces:
  events:
    produces:
      - exercise.started
      - exercise.completed
    consumes:
      - coaching.session.started

acceptance_criteria:
  - ExerciseLibrary accessible from coaching session overlay
  - "Warm Up" button/section visible before recording
  - Exercise completion tracked in session metadata
  - Styling matches journey page aesthetic
  - No TypeScript or build errors

test_plan:
  integration:
    - Import widget into /app/journey/page.tsx
    - Add to coaching overlay layout
    - Verify exercise flow
  e2e:
    - User starts coaching session, sees warm-up option
    - User completes exercise, proceeds to recording
    - Session metadata includes exercise completion

risk: low
estimate: 0.75 days

dependencies: []

technical_notes: |
  - Widget exists at /src/widgets/ExerciseLibrary/
  - Add new tab/section in coaching overlay before main coaching panel
  - Could create "Warm Up → Record → Review" flow
  - Track exercise completion in session state
