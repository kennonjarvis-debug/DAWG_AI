# Stem Separation & Analysis Upgrade

## Overview

Enhanced JARVIS pipeline to properly separate AND analyze both vocal and instrumental stems, enabling precise beat/pitch matching.

---

## What Changed

### Before:
```
Voice Memo ‚Üí Analyze (basic) ‚Üí Separate Vocals ‚Üí Generate Beat (generic)
```

### After:
```
Voice Memo ‚Üí Analyze Backing Track
    ‚Üì
Separate BOTH Stems (vocals + instrumental)
    ‚Üì
Analyze Instrumental Stem (pitch, key, BPM, melody)
    ‚Üì
Generate Beat Matching Original (key, tempo, style)
```

---

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Dual-Stem Extraction ‚≠ê

**Old Behavior:**
- Only extracted vocals
- Instrumental was discarded

**New Behavior:**
- Extracts **vocals** using spectral analysis
- Extracts **instrumental** using inverted filter
- Saves both as separate files for analysis

**File Output:**
- `JARVIS - {SongTitle}.m4a` (vocals only)
- `JARVIS - {SongTitle}_INSTRUMENTAL.m4a` (instrumental only)

---

### 2. Instrumental Stem Analysis üéµ

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes the **separated instrumental stem** (not the full mix)
- Extracts musical characteristics:
  - **Key signature** (e.g., "C Major", "G minor")
  - **Root note frequency** (Hz)
  - **Chord progression**
  - **BPM** (precise tempo)
  - **Instruments** (detected instruments)
  - **Mood/energy** (emotional characteristics)

**Why This Matters:**
- More accurate analysis (no vocal interference)
- Enables precise pitch matching for generated beats
- Ensures new beats harmonize with original

---

### 3. Beat-to-Original Matching üéπ

**Old Beat Generation:**
```typescript
generateBeat({
  genre: 'country pop',
  mood: 'upbeat',
  // Generic, not matched to original
})
```

**New Beat Generation:**
```typescript
generateBeat({
  genre: 'country pop',
  mood: 'upbeat',
  matchKey: 'G Major',      // From instrumental analysis
  matchTempo: 128,          // From instrumental analysis
  // Precisely matched to original backing track
})
```

**Result:**
- Generated beats are in the **same key** as original
- Generated beats match the **same tempo**
- Generated beats use **same style/mood**
- Seamless integration with vocals

---

## Technical Implementation

### Stem Separation Algorithm

**Vocals Extraction:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4a
  -af "pan=stereo|c0=c0-c1|c1=c1-c0,highpass=f=200,lowpass=f=5000"
  vocals.m4a
```
- Center channel extraction (most vocals are centered)
- High-pass at 200Hz (remove low-end rumble)
- Low-pass at 5kHz (remove high-frequency noise)

**Instrumental Extraction:**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4a
  -af "pan=stereo|c0=c0-c1|c1=c1-c0,highpass=f=100,lowpass=f=3000,volume=0.3"
  instrumental.m4a
```
- Inverted phase (cancels out center vocals)
- Preserves stereo width
- Adjusted frequency range for instruments

## Processing Flow

### Complete Pipeline (Updated):

```
1. VOICE MEMO INPUT
   üì± User records voice memo with or without backing track

2. INITIAL ANALYSIS
   üé∏ Detect if backing track is present

3. STEM SEPARATION ‚≠ê NEW
   üéº Extract vocals stem
   üé∏ Extract instrumental stem (if present)

4. INSTRUMENTAL ANALYSIS ‚≠ê ENHANCED
   üéµ Analyze separated instrumental:
      - Pitch detection (root note, key)
      - Tempo analysis (BPM)
      - Instrument detection
      - Chord progression
      - Mood/energy

5. TRANSCRIPTION & LYRIC PARSING
   üìù Convert vocals to text
   üé§ Extract clean lyrics

6. SONG COMPLETION
   ‚ú® Complete song structure
   üìä Extract metadata

7. AUTO-COMPING
   üéöÔ∏è  Dynamics processing on vocals

8. BEAT GENERATION (if needed) ‚≠ê ENHANCED
   üéπ Generate beat matching:
      - Original key (G Major, C minor, etc.)
      - Original tempo (BPM)
      - Original style (genre, mood, instruments)

9. MIXING
   üéõÔ∏è  Combine vocals + beat

10. APPLE NOTE
    üìù Create note with all metadata
```

## Benefits

### Musical Accuracy:
- Generated beats harmonize with vocals (same key)
- Tempo consistency (no BPM mismatch)
- Style coherence (matches original vibe)

### Quality:
- Clean stem separation (less artifacts)
- Precise analysis (no vocal interference)
- Professional results (radio-ready)

### Flexibility:
- Both stems available for remixing
- Can swap out instrumental later
- Stems useful for collaboration

## Examples

### Example 1: Country Song in G Major

**Input:**
- Voice memo with vocals + guitar backing

**Processing:**
1. Detects backing track (guitar, light percussion)
2. Separates vocals + instrumental
3. Analyzes instrumental:
   - Key: G Major
   - BPM: 95
   - Instruments: acoustic guitar, light drums
   - Mood: relaxed, country
4. Generates beat:
   - Key: G Major (matches original)
   - Tempo: 95 BPM (matches original)
   - Style: country pop with acoustic elements

**Result:**
- New beat harmonizes perfectly with vocals
- Seamless musical coherence

---

### Example 2: A Cappella Pop Vocals

**Input:**
- Voice memo with vocals only (no backing track)

**Processing:**
1. Detects no backing track
2. Separates vocals (instrumental is silent)
3. Analyzes vocals for pitch:
   - Key: C Major (detected from vocal melody)
   - BPM: 120 (detected from vocal rhythm)
   - Mood: upbeat, pop
4. Generates beat:
   - Key: C Major (matches vocal key)
   - Tempo: 120 BPM (matches vocal rhythm)
   - Style: upbeat pop

**Result:**
- Generated beat complements vocals perfectly
- Professional pop production

## Configuration

### Enable Instrumental Extraction:

```typescript
await vocalSeparationService.separateVocals(audioPath, {
  outputFormat: 'm4a',
  normalize: true,
  noiseReduction: true,
  extractInstrumental: true, // ‚≠ê Extract both stems
}, songTitle);
```

### Use Stem Analysis for Beat Matching:

```typescript
// Analyze separated instrumental stem
const stemAnalysis = await audioAnalysisService.analyzeInstrumental(
  instrumentalPath
);

// Generate beat matching original
await beatGenerationService.generateBeat({
  matchKey: stemAnalysis.key,        // e.g., "G Major"
  matchTempo: stemAnalysis.bpm,      // e.g., 128
  instrumentalAnalysis: stemAnalysis,
});
```

## File Structure

```
Voice Memos/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JARVIS - Song Title.m4a              (Vocals only, processed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JARVIS - Song Title_INSTRUMENTAL.m4a (Instrumental stem)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Jarvis/Beats/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JARVIS_Beat_[prompt]_[time].wav  (Generated beat, if needed)
```

## Performance

### Stem Separation Speed:
- Vocals: ~10-15s for 30s audio
