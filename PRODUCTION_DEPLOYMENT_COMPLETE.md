- üîä Voice feedback (if TTS enabled)

### 3. Voice Memo Test

**Steps:**
1. Click "Voice Memo" panel
2. Click record and speak a musical idea
3. Wait for auto-transcription (1-3 seconds)
4. Check AI analysis results (music, lyrics, rhythm, mood detected)
5. Test "Convert to Clip" functionality

### 4. Performance Test

**Metrics to Check:**
- Initial load time: < 3 seconds
- Voice command response: < 100ms (basic), < 5s (AI)

## üìà Usage Analytics

### OpenAI API Cost Tracking

**Expected Costs per User Session:**
- Basic voice commands (Web Speech): $0.00 (free)
- Whisper transcription: $0.006 per minute
- GPT-4 command analysis: $0.01-0.03 per command
- TTS voice feedback: $0.015 per 1000 characters
- **Average session cost: $0.10-0.50**

**Monthly Cost Estimates:**
- 100 active users: $10-50/month
- 1,000 active users: $100-500/month
- 10,000 active users: $1,000-5,000/month

### Monitoring Dashboard

Track usage in real-time:
- OpenAI API usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Netlify bandwidth: https://app.netlify.com/projects/dawg-ai/bandwidth
- Error tracking: Browser console + Netlify logs

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Microphone not accessible"

**Solution:**
1. Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
2. Grant microphone access
3. Reload page
4. Ensure HTTPS (voice control requires secure context)

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"

**Solution:**
1. Check API key is set: https://dawg-ai.com should show voice controls
2. Verify API key in Netlify environment variables
3. Check OpenAI account has credits
4. View network tab for specific error codes (401, 429, etc.)

### Issue: "Commands not executing"

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console and check for JavaScript errors
2. Verify stores are initialized (check Redux/Zustand devtools)
3. Try exact commands: "play", "pause", "add track"
4. Switch to AI mode if basic commands don't work
5. Check that OpenAI API key is properly loaded

### Issue: "Poor transcription accuracy"

**Solution:**
1. Upgrade to AI mode (uses Whisper instead of Web Speech)
2. Speak clearly near microphone
3. Reduce background noise
4. Check microphone levels in system settings
5. Try using headset microphone for better quality

## üîê Security Notes

### API Key Security

‚úÖ **Best Practices Implemented:**
- API key stored in environment variables (not in code)
- HTTPS enforced (required for Web Speech API)
- No API keys logged or exposed in frontend
- Rate limiting in place

‚ö†Ô∏è **Additional Recommendations:**
- Set up API usage alerts on OpenAI dashboard
- Implement backend proxy for API calls (hide key from frontend)
- Add request throttling to prevent abuse
- Monitor for unusual usage patterns

### Microphone Permissions

‚úÖ **User Privacy Protected:**
- Microphone access requires explicit user permission
- Audio only processed when voice control active
- No audio stored on servers (transcription only)
- OpenAI API terms: audio data not used for training
