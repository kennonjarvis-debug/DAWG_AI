# Production Setup Summary - www.dawg-ai.com/app

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: üîß Ready to Configure & Test

---

## üéØ What We're Doing

Testing and configuring the **LIVE production app** at **https://www.dawg-ai.com/app**

### Goals:
1. ‚úÖ Finish Google Auth setup for production domain
2. ‚úÖ Test all components (atoms, molecules, organisms) on live site
3. ‚úÖ Verify everything works end-to-end

---

## üìã Quick Action Plan

### Step 1: Configure Google OAuth (5 min)

**What**: Add production domain to Google OAuth

**How**: Follow `PRODUCTION_GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md` Steps 1-2

**Quick version**:
1. Google Cloud Console ‚Üí OAuth Client ‚Üí Add authorized origins:
   - `https://www.dawg-ai.com`
   - `https://dawg-ai.com`

2. Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí URL Configuration:
   - Site URL: `https://www.dawg-ai.com`
   - Redirect URLs: `https://www.dawg-ai.com/**`

3. Supabase ‚Üí Providers ‚Üí Google ‚Üí Verify enabled with Client ID/Secret

### Step 2: Verify Railway Deployment (2 min)

**Check Railway Dashboard**:
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/dazzling-happiness
2. Check **Variables** tab
3. Verify these are set:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://nvyebkzrrvmepbdejspr.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=(your key)
   ```

**If any are missing**: Add them and trigger redeploy

---

### Step 3: Test Production Auth (5 min)

**URL**: https://www.dawg-ai.com/app

**Test flow**:
1. Open the app
2. Click Sign In (wherever auth modal opens)
3. Try **Continue with Google**
4. Sign in with Google account
5. Should redirect back logged in
6. Refresh page - should stay logged in
7. Sign out - should work
8. Try email/password signup - should work

**Check browser console** for any errors!

### Step 4: Test Components on Live Site (10 min)

**What to test**:

#### Atoms (Basic Components)
- [ ] Click buttons - do they respond?
- [ ] Drag faders - smooth?
- [ ] Rotate knobs - working?
- [ ] Toggle switches - on/off?
- [ ] Type in inputs - accepting input?
- [ ] Icons displaying correctly?
- [ ] Meters animating?

#### Molecules (Complex Components)
- [ ] Transport controls (play/stop/record)
- [ ] Track headers (mute/solo/arm)
- [ ] Fader channels work together
- [ ] Waveform displays

#### Organisms (Full Sections)
- [ ] Mixer displays with multiple tracks
- [ ] Effects rack shows effects
- [ ] Browser panel navigates files
- [ ] Inspector panel shows properties

**Access test page** (if deployed):
https://www.dawg-ai.com/app/test/components

**Or test on main interface** if test page isn't deployed yet.

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs
- Auth modal opens without errors
- Google sign-in redirects properly
- Components render visually
- Interactions work smoothly
- No console errors
- Mobile responsive

### ‚ùå Red Flags
- Console errors (especially auth-related)
- Components not rendering
- Buttons not clickable
- Faders/knobs frozen
- Auth redirects fail
- "OAuth not configured" errors

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "OAuth provider not configured"
**Fix**: Complete Step 1 (Google OAuth configuration)

### Issue: Blank page or components not showing
**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab - are assets loading?
3. Railway build logs - did build succeed?

### Issue: Auth works locally but not production
**Check**:
1. Railway environment variables match local `.env`
2. Supabase Site URL is production domain
3. Google OAuth has production domain in authorized origins

### Issue: Components look broken
**Possible causes**:
1. CSS not loading (check Network tab)
2. Theme not initializing
3. Missing environment variables

---

## üì± Testing on Mobile

Don't forget to test on mobile devices:
- [ ] Open on iPhone/Android
- [ ] Auth flow works on mobile
- [ ] Components are touch-friendly
- [ ] Layout responsive
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

---

## üöÄ Deployment Info

**Platform**: Railway
**Project**: dazzling-happiness
**Auto-deploy**: Yes (pushes to main branch trigger deploy)

**To redeploy**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically:
1. Build the app (`npm run build`)
